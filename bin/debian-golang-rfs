Dear Go team,

I am looking for a sponsor for the package "${package}".
This package is a prerequisite for upcoming package "lazygit" (#908894).

I pushed to our team's Salsa:

  https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages/${package}

Could you please reviewing/sponsoring this?
Any kind of reviews and suggestions are appreciated.
